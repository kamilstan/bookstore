# BookStore App

This project is a back-end part of my application made in React.js, Express.js, TypeScript and MySQL.

You can check how it looks like here: 

## Introduction

This project is a simple bookstore system, where you can register, log in as a customer or admin. As a customer you can check the book list and information about every single book and buy books. As an admin you can list books, check information about every single book and add new book. You can also list all the customers.

This is my project after completing the  MegaK course [https://MegaK.pl].

The project will be expanded with new functionalities in the future.
